# Matrix Multiplication in Assembly Language

This project implements matrix multiplication in assembly language. It prompts the user to enter dimensions for two matrices, generates random numbers to populate the matrices, performs matrix multiplication efficiently, and displays the result.

## Features:

- Interactive user input for matrix dimensions.
- Dynamic memory allocation for matrices.
- Efficient matrix multiplication algorithm.
- Random number generation for matrix initialization.
- Memory management and stack manipulation.

## Usage:

1. Assemble and run the code using an x86 assembly language compiler (e.g., MASM).
2. Follow the prompts to enter dimensions for the matrices.
3. View the generated matrices M1 and M2, along with the resulting matrix MP.
4. Study the code to understand low-level programming concepts and algorithms.

## Requirements:

- Irvine32.inc 
- x86 assembly language compiler (e.g., MASM)
